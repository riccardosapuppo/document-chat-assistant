/**
 * The README, checked against the repository it describes.
 *
 * A README is the one file everybody reads and nothing verifies, so it rots in
 * a particular way: the code moves and the prose stays, and the first person to
 * notice is a stranger typing the first command. This repository had three of
 * those at once — a Node version that was wrong, a check count that said 86
 * when 92 ran, and a browser requirement that named the wrong browser.
 *
 * The delivery rule says every README example must be run and **tied to a
 * check, so that it cannot stop being true**. This is that check for everything
 * static. The per-harness totals are checked by the harnesses themselves, at
 * the end of their own runs, where the number is a fact rather than a promise.
