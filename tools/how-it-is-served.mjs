/**
 * How the console is served, checked against the running service.
 *
 *     npm run check:serving
 *
 * This exists because a caching header is the kind of thing that is right in
 * the source and wrong in the response. `express.static(dir, { etag: false })`
 * reads as "no revalidation" and is not: `lastModified` is a separate option
 * that defaults to true, so every file still went out with a `Last-Modified`,
 * every reload was a conditional request, and a browser is entitled to answer
 * one from its own cache with a 304 — which is how somebody presses reload
 * after a rebuild and gets the page from before it.
 *
 * The advice that follows is always "press Ctrl+F5", and it sends people
 * looking at the server while the page is being served by their own browser and
 * sometimes by a service worker nobody remembers installing.
 *
 * So this asserts, against a service that is really running:
 *
 *   - the page is `no-store`, with no `ETag` and no `Last-Modified`
 *   - so is everything it loads, because nothing here is fingerprinted and
 *     immutable without a fingerprint means a change that never arrives
 *   - a request that NAMES A FILE and has not got one is a 404, never the
 *     application dressed as a file
 *   - the page unregisters any service worker left on this origin
