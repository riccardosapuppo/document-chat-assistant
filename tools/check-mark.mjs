/**
 * The mark, checked at the size it is actually seen.
 *
 *     npm run check:mark
 *
 * There is one drawing — `public/mark.svg` — and both the browser tab and the
 * header point at that one file, so there is no second copy to drift. What can
 * still go wrong is subtler and is the thing that actually goes wrong: a mark
 * that looks considered at 200 pixels and is a grey smudge at 16, which is the
 * only size anybody sees it at.
 *
 * So this renders it at tab size and asks whether the idea survived. The mark
 * is two pages side by side with one of them marked, and the mark is the
 * whole idea: the same question, answered twice, and one of the two picked. If
 * that violet bar is not there at 16 pixels the drawing says nothing, and the
 * answer is to redraw it rather than to defend it.
 *
 * It also refuses a mark that is a picture. Text in an icon is illegible at
 * this size, and an embedded image is a screenshot wearing an icon's clothes.
